# 🛰️ Time Series Anomaly Detection for IoT Sensors

This project is an **end-to-end solution** for detecting anomalies in IoT sensor data using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques.  

---

## 📘 Overview

The project simulates a **run-to-failure scenario** using the **NASA Bearing Dataset** and builds two anomaly detection models:
- 🧩 **Isolation Forest (I-Forest)** — a tree-based unsupervised anomaly detector.
- 🧠 **LSTM Autoencoder** — a deep learning model for time-series reconstruction error detection.

The pipeline is fully modular and production-ready, making it easy to extend or integrate with real-world IoT systems.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
First, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### 2️⃣ Download the Data

You have two options:

#### 🔹 Automatic Download (using Kaggle API)

If you have your Kaggle API token (`kaggle.json`) in your `~/.kaggle/` directory,
the script will automatically download the dataset:

```
vinayak123tyagi/bearing-dataset
```

#### 🔹 Manual Download

Alternatively, manually download **bearing-dataset.zip** from Kaggle and place it in the project root folder.
The script will automatically detect it and skip the download step.

---

### 3️⃣ Run the Full Pipeline

Execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The pipeline performs the following steps with detailed console logs:

1. Sets up logging at `outputs/pipeline.log`
2. Checks and processes raw data into a clean time series
3. Generates EDA plots (distributions, run-to-failure) → `outputs/plots/`
4. Performs feature engineering (rolling stats, seasonal decomposition)
5. Trains and evaluates:

   * Isolation Forest
   * LSTM Autoencoder
6. Saves trained models → `outputs/models/`
7. Generates final anomaly comparison plots → `outputs/plots/`
